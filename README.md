# TEND_Subsetting_Data

### This markdown will serve as a reference sheet for different subsetting methods, packages, applications, and more. More specifically, how to subset data casewise, listwise, by ID, or by variable. Having a large and complex df could prevent you from gaining insight about specific data. Having the ability to call for certain ID numbers or variables, like gender or age, allows you to use a magnifying glass on your large df. I also plan on learning and practicing substringing values, and being able to remove the "sub" from "sub-xxxx" in the subject ID column. The key differences between substringing and subsetting is that substringing is applied to character strings like text files, and can output specific ranges or positions in a long character string. A subset is more widely used because it can be applied to data frames and other data structures. Based off of certain arguments or criteria, a subset can give you a closer look on specific points in your data structure. Subsets are represented by brackets[], and more of the syntax will be learned with time and practice.
